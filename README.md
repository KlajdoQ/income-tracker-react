App built with React using components, props and State. 

This app allows you to keep track of expenses and your current income. 
It is designed in a very user friendly way. 

1. On the top we have the current amount of money. 
That amound changes depending on the type of transactions you make. 

2. The app is split into two table columns. One is the Transaction Type and the other one is the actual Amount. 

3. The user writes downt the name of the transaction and then has to enter the amount of money. 
4. At this point they have to choose is this money is Received or Spent. 
If the money is Spent the transaction will be a negative number.
